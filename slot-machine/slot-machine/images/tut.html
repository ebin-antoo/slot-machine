<p>Whether you're a gambler, or just likes to hit the slots every now and then, or maybe neither, you might enjoy this tutorial. In this tutorial we'll be creating a slot machine. We'll build it from simple vector shapes, then color it, use the Appearance panel to add effects, use symbols and the symbol tools and end up with a nice slot machine. Let's get started!</p>

<hr /><h2>Step 1</h2>
<p>Now, before we start drawing, we need some inspiration. Go to your browser and search for slot machine pictures. See what different elements compose the machines. Gather different elements from different machines to create your suited machine.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="1.jpg" border="0" /></div>

<hr /><h2>Step 2</h2>
<p>Create a new Adobe Illustrator web document with a 600 x 800 pixels artboart. Give it a name - I called mine "slot_machine". Before we begin we need to do some setups. Go to the Symblos panel, click on the top-right button to open the drop-down menu and click on "Select All Unused". Drag all the selected symbols to the trash icon to delete them.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="2a.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Do the same with the Swatches panel. You're supposed to be left the with 4 swatches: [None], [Registration], White and Black. Double-click on the white swatch, and check "Global". Do the same for the black swatch.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="2b.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Open the Preferences panel (Ctrl/Command + K), go to "Guides &amp; Grid" and set the following settings:</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="2c.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>If you can't see the grid, click Ctrl/Command + " to show it. Also, from the View menu, make sure Smart Guides and Snap to Grid are on. We're now done setting up our workspace, let's create the slot machine!</p>

<hr /><h2>Step 3</h2>
<p>We're going to construct the machine from simple shapes, and when done we'll add colors. With the Rectangle tool (M), draw a 360 x 136 pixels rectangle. Leave it with the default Stroke and Fill, as we'll be coloring the machine later on. Go to Object &gt; Path &gt; Offset Path... and enter -16 for the Offset value.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="3.jpg" border="0" /></div>

<hr /><h2>Step 4</h2>
<p>Create another rectangle, 360 x 200 pixels, and snap it to the bottom of the outer rectangle we created last step. Select the bottom-right anchor point with the Direct Selection Tool (A), hold the Shift key and press the right arrow key 3 times to move the point 30 pixels to the right. Do the same with the bottom-left anchor point to move it 30 pixels to the left. Your rectangle should now look like a trapezoid. Like on the previous step, select your shape and offset the path, this time by -10 pixels. Then offset the inner trapezoid's path by -20 pixels. Your artwork should now look like this:</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="4.jpg" border="0" /></div>

<hr /><h2>Step 5</h2>
<p>With the Pen tool (P), draw lines from the innermost trapezoid's corners to the middle trapezoid's corners. This is where having Smart Guides turned on becomes helpful, as it helps you spot the corners accurately. Select the two trapezoid shapes and the newly created lines, go to the Pathfinder panel and click "Divide". Ungroup the divided shapes (Object &gt; Ungroup).</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="5.jpg" border="0" /></div>

<hr /><h2>Step 6</h2>
<p>Draw a new 420 x 150 pixels rectangle, snap it to the bottom of the outer trapezoid and offset it's path by -10 pixels. Create another rectangle, 400 x 46 pixels, and snap it to the bottom of the previously created rectangle. Your machine should by now look like this:</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="6.jpg" border="0" /></div>

<hr /><h2>Step 7</h2>
<p>Now let's draw the money drawer. Outside the artboard, create a 320 x 80 pixels rectangle. Move the bottom-right anchor point 50 pixels to the right, and the left one, 50 pixels to the left. Offset the shape's path by -10. Draw a third rectangle that will cover the top 10 pixels of the outer shape. Select both the outer shape and the rectangle, go to the Pathfinder panel and hit "Minus Front". Send the shape to the back using Ctrl/Command + Shift + [.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="7a.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Select the inner shape and offset its path by -10 pixels. Move it 10 pixels down. Draw two 20-pixels-high lines with the Pen tool and align them like so:</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="7b.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Select all shapes and in the Pathfinder panel hit "Divide" and ungroup. Select the outermost shape and remove the excess points with the Delete Anchor Point Tool (-).</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="7c.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Select the innermost trapezoid shape and the rectangle above it, and copy and paste in front (Ctrl/Command + F). Merge these shapes (in the Pathfinder panel hit "Merge") and set the new shape's width to 80 pixels.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="7d.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Draw a 420 x 36 pixels rectangle and snap it to the bottom of the drawer. Select all shapes and drag them to the bottom of our slot machine as shown:</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="7e.jpg" border="0" /></div>

<hr /><h2>Step 8</h2>
<p>Create five 60 x 24 pixels rectangles in a row on top of the machine. Draw a 316 x 32 rectangle and place it behind the five rectangles (Ctrl/Command + Shift + [ to move to back). Align it to the bottom of the other rectangles. Group all shapes.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="8a.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Draw another rectangle, 316 x 32 pixels. Make it a trapezoid by moving the top anchor points 10 pixels inwards. Place it in top of the grouped shape.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="8b.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Select both shapes and go to Object &gt; Envelope Distort &gt; Make with Top Object. Then go to Object &gt; Expand, click OK and ungroup.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="8c.jpg" border="0" /></div>

<hr /><h2>Step 9</h2>
<p>For this step I used an Illustrator script called "Round Any Corner." It does exactly that: rounds only the corner you want, instead of all the object's corners. You can read about it <a href="http://vector.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-tips/5-ways-to-customize-adobe-illustrator/"><span class="s1">in the article on ways to customize Adobe Illustrator</span></a> and download it <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/exchange/index.cfm?event=extensionDetail&amp;extid=1045709"><span class="s1">here.</span></a> Once you are set, use the Direct Selection tool (A) to select the 4 corners in image below, then click Ctrl/Command + F12, go to the folder where you saved the script file and open it. Enter 6 as the corner radius in the script prompt and click OK.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="9a.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>The machine's skeleton is done, let's proceed and give it life!</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="9b.jpg" border="0" /></div>

<hr /><h2>Step 10</h2>
<p>Let's start with the top. Select the outer shape on the top, and give it the following gradient settings (drag the black global swatch color we prepared earlier over the gradient stops):</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="10a.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Select the leftmost and rightmost shapes and give them the following gradient settings:</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="10b.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Add a 30% black 1-pixel stroke, and set it to the inside. Go to the Appearance panel and add a new fill. Set it to the following:</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="10c.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>In the same way go to the next 2 inner shapes and give them a gradient from R:56, G:201, B:226 to R:0, G:113, B:188. Add the same new black to white fill, and the same stroke as the previous shapes. For the middle shape, add a gradient from R:255, G:166, B:171 to R:201, G:5, B:3. Add the same new black to white fill, and the same stroke as the previous shapes.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="10d.jpg" border="0" /></div>

<hr /><h2>Step 11</h2>
<p>Proceed to the next shapes. Let's add some metallic colors to our machine. Feel free to experiment and change the colors to your likings. This what I had in mind:</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="11a.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p></p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="11b.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Proceed to the middle part of the machine:</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="11c.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p></p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="11d.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Let's add some metallic red:</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="11e.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>And now continue to the bottom part:</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="11f.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p></p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="11g.jpg" border="0" /></div>

<hr /><h2>Step 12</h2>
<p>Almost done with the coloring. Let's just take care of the drawer:</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="12a.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p></p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="12b.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p></p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="12c.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Well, we're done coloring. Take a look at what we've got, grab another cup of coffee, and let's proceed.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="12d.jpg" border="0" /></div>

<hr /><h2>Step 13</h2>
<p>Let's create bulbs around the outer frame. Create a 8 x 8 pixels circle using the Ellipse tool (L). Place it 4 pixels away from the bottom-left corner and give it the following settings:</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="13a.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>With the circle still selected, use the Gradient tool (G) to drag the gradient a little higher to the left, so it won't be centered.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="13b.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Add the following Transform effect (go to Effect &gt; Distort & Transform &gt; Transform...). Duplicate the bulbs and place the copy on the right side of the frame, again 4 pixels away from the edge.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="13c.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Create another copy, move it 13 pixels to the right. Duplicate this one and move it 4 pixels lower to the frame's top, as shown. Change the transform effect to the following:</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="13d.jpg" border="0" /></div>

<hr /><h2>Step 14</h2>
<p>In this step we'll create the spinning reels. Firstly, we have to create some symbols. Usually there are fruits, the number 7, a dollar sign, etc. I have created the following symbols (which are added in the file), you can add your own.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="14a.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Back to the machine, create three 80 x 110 pixels rectangles, spread them 100 pixels away from each other, fill them with black and give them a 2 points outside stroke of 30% black.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="14b.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Somewhere on the artboard draw a white rectangle of the same size, with no stroke. While selected, hover with the Pen tool (P) over the left side of the rectangle, and click in the middle of the line. If you have Smart Guides on, you'll see the exact middle of the line. Add another point on the right side.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="14c.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Use the Direct Selection tool (A) to move the right corners 5 pixels to the left, and the left corners 5 pixels to the right. Then select the middle points we created and on the Control bar, hit the "Convert selected anchor points to smooth" button.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="14d.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Drag the points' handles, holding the Shift key, to make the object a little more rounded. Use the grid to be more accurate.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="14e.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Place 3 copies of this shape on top the the black rectangles we created earlier. Then arrange some of the symbols we created on top of the white rectangles.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="14f.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Draw a 280 x 110 pixels rectangle on top of the symbols. Then select both the symbols and the rectangle and hit Ctrl/Command + 7 to create a clipping mask. You should end up with this:</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="14g.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Duplicate the white shapes we created and place them on top of the symbols. Add them a gradient. Also draw horizontal lines across each white shape. Use the settings shown here:</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="14h.jpg" border="0" /></div>
 
<hr /><h2>Step 15</h2>
<p>Now, let's create some buttons for the bottom panel. Draw a 50 x 50 pixels rectangle and give it the following style:</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="15a.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Create 3 copies of the button, spread them 86 pixels away from each other. Create some labels on the buttons. I used a nice free font: <a href="http://www.dafont.com/zrnic.font">Zrnic</a>. Give the labels the following shadow effect:</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="15b.jpg" border="0" /></div>

<hr /><h2>Step 16</h2>
<p>Moving on to the coin slot, draw a 14 x 80 pixels rectangle, with the following settings:</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="16a.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Draw a 6 x 72 pixels rectangle on top of the previous one, with the settings shown below:</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="16b.jpg" border="0" /></div>

<hr /><h2>Step 17</h2>
<p>Since we're all winners in this tutorial, let's fill the machine with coins. I drew a simple coin, and saved it as a symbol. I used the Symbol Sprayer tool (Shift + S) to fill the illustration with coins. Double-click the tool's icon to open up the options window. Try and experiment with the values to get the result you'd like.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="17a.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Don't fill the area with too many coins, we'll do that in several steps. First draw several coins, then use the Symbol Spinner tool (long click on the Symbol Sprayer tool icon) to rotate the coins a little, so they don't look all the same. When done, click somewhere on the artboard to release the symbol set, and then create another set of coins. This way you'll be able to create different layers of the coins and adjust them separately. Then make sure the drawer parts are on top of the coins, like this:</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="17b.jpg" border="0" /></div>

<hr /><h2>Step 18</h2>
<p>Go back to the top of the machine. Let's put a nice plate there on the empty metal shape. Use your imagination and inspiration from the images we searched on step 1. I won't get into details on how I built my plate, as it's a subject for another tutorial... This is what I have:</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="18.jpg" border="0" /></div>

<hr /><h2>Step 19</h2>
<p>Didn't we forget something? The lever! Draw a 36 x 36 pixels circle. Use the Direct Selection tool (A) to move the right anchor point 2 pixels to the left. Add the following gradient:</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="19a.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Duplicate this shape and paste it behind the previous circle (Ctrl/Command + B). Move it a little to the right and reduce its size.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="19b.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Draw a 10 x 160 pixels rectangle, tilt it a little to the right. Give it a light to dark grey gradient, and place it behind the previously drawn shapes:</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="19c.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>To finish, add a 30 x 30 pixels circle on the top part of the lever, and color it with a metallic red radial gradient. Use the Gradient tool (G) to drag the gradient a little higher to the left.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="19d.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Group all objects and place them behind the machine:
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="19e.jpg" border="0" /></div>

<hr /><h2>Step 20</h2>
<p>Select the entire machine (Ctrl/Command + A) and group (Ctrl/Command + G). Copy and paste in front. In the Pathfinder panel hit Unite. As you can see, it didn't create one shape, since we have symbols:</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="20a.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>We need to get rid of the symbols. To do that, hit Ctrl/Command + G to group, and then double click to enter Isolation Mode. Select all shapes apart from the main machine shape, and delete them.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="20b.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Add a Drop Shadow effect (Effect &gt; Shadow &gt; Drop Shadow...) with the following settings:</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="20c.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Send this shape to the back by hitting Ctrl/Command + Shift + [.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="20d.jpg" border="0" /></div>

<hr /><h2>Step 21</h2>
<p>Let's add some shadow to the bottom of the machine. Draw a black shape, reduce its opacity to 25% and send it to the back.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="21a.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>Go to Effect &gt; Blur &gt; Gaussian Blur... and set 20 pixels radius.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="21b.jpg" border="0" /></div>

<hr /><h2>Final Image</h2>
<p>For a final touch I added a background layer, and there you have it!</p>
<p>In this tutorial we built a slot machine from simple vector shapes. We used the Appearance panel to add effects, use symbols and symbol tools. I hope you enjoyed this tutorial.</p>
